title: 'Rate Limiting'
---

The SureCart API uses a number of safeguards against bursts of incoming traffic to help maximize its stability. If you send many requests in quick succession, you might see error responses with status code 429.

### API Limiters

We have several limiters in the API, including a rate limiter and a concurrency limiter. Treat the limits as maximums, and donâ€™t generate unnecessary load. To prevent abuse, we might reduce the limits.

You can request a limit increase to enable a high-traffic application by contacting SureCart Support.

### Rate Limits

The basic rate limiter restricts the number of API requests as follows:

Default Limit: 150 operations / 10 seconds

Sensitive Endpoints: 10 operations / 1 minute

Public Endpoints: 60 operations / 1 minute

Sensitive endpoints include those that may trigger notifications or call third-party services. In general, these are endpoints that should not be called frequently.

Public endpoints are those that are accessible with a public API key. For example, our license check endpoint.

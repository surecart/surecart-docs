title: 'Webhooks'
---

SureCart uses webhooks to notify your application when an event happens in your account. Webhooks are particularly useful for asynchronous events like when a subscription is updated or a charge is refunded.

You can create and manage your webhook endpoints through the API endpoints or within your dashboard. From your dashboard you can also see a log of recent events that have been sent.

### Events

Webhooks are triggered based on events. Events are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in your account. When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event` object. For example, when an order is created, we create a `order.created` event.

The request payload of each webhook will contain the `Event` object, which is structured like the following example.

```json
{
  "id": "5bafe7b7-a4e3-4a7d-85e9-d8b512094b67",
  "object": "event",
  "data": {
    "object": {
      "id": "0d6edf76-98f3-441c-9c43-81a92e929988",
      "object": "order",
      "live_mode": true,
      "number": "0008",
      "order_type": "checkout",
      "statement_url": "https://app.surecart.com/statements/orders/0d6edf76-98f3-441c-9c43-81a92e929988",
      "status": "paid",
      "checkout": "f1a38ad4-f87d-4550-b2e0-91a128cadf06",
      "created_at": 1664479758,
      "updated_at": 1664479758
    }
  },
  "type": "order.created",
  "account": "b7cfbc09-371a-453e-ab29-2edf63de0dbe",
  "created_at": 1664479758
}
```

When listeneing for webhooks at your webhook endpoint you will want to look at the `event.type` value to determine what type of event your endpoint has received. For example, the above webhook is a `order.created` event.

### Types of Events

This is a list of all the types of events we currently send. We may add more at any time, so in developing and maintaining your code, you should not assume that only these types exist.

You'll notice that these events follow a pattern: `resource.event`. Our goal is to design a consistent system that makes things easier to anticipate and code against.

### Webhook Delivery Timeouts

SureCart expects webhook endpoints to acknowledge receipt of an event within **approximately 10 seconds**. If a response is not received within this time window, the delivery attempt is considered failed and will be retried based on our retry strategy.

To ensure successful processing:

* Your endpoint should return a `2xx` HTTP status code as quickly as possible.
* Perform all time-consuming logic (e.g., database updates, third-party API calls) asynchronously in the background.
* Avoid long-running synchronous operations that could cause the request to time out.

Proper timeout handling helps ensure reliable event delivery and minimizes duplicate webhook attempts caused by delays.

### Expanding Webhook Events

All webhooks contain the parent resource of the corresponding event and do not expand any related objects. This keeps webhook payloads small and ensures unecessary data is not being sent. 

If you wish to expand a resource you will need to make a subsequent retrieve request with the expansions you need. [See the Expanding Responses documentation for more detail.](https://developer.surecart.com/reference/expanding-responses)

### Webhook Signatures

All webhooks include a signature in each requestâ€™s `x-webhook-signature` header. This allows you to verify that the events were sent by us, and not by a third party. We generate signatures using a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) with SHA-256.

We generate a unique signing secret key for each endpoint. If you use multiple endpoints, you must use the unique signing secret for each one you want to verify signatures on. You can view the signing secret for each endpoint from within your dashboard, or you can retrive it from the API.

### Preventing Replay Attacks

A replay attack is when an attacker intercepts a valid payload and its signature, then re-transmits them. To mitigate such attacks, we include a timestamp in the `x-webhook-timestamp` header. This timestamp is also part of the signed payload and verified by the signature, so an attacker cannot change the timestamp without invalidating the signature. If the signature is valid but the timestamp is too old, you can have your application reject the payload.

We generate the timestamp and signature each time we send an event to your endpoint. If we retry an event (for example, your endpoint previously replied with a non-2xx status code), then we generate a new signature and timestamp for the new delivery attempt.

### Verify Signatures

**Step 1: Extract Signature and Timestamp**\
The `signature` is sent in the `x-webhook-signature` header, and the `timestamp` is sent in the `x-webhook-timestamp` header.

```
x-webhook-signature = "287ace7f0267943970dca9e895be11a739b532b85dfed8a3d147ca2d08267f48"
x-webhook-timestamp = "1641873601"
```

**Step 2: Prepare Signed Payload String**\
The signed\_payload string is created by concatenating the timestamp and the payload with the . character.

**Step 3: Determine Expected Signature**\
Compute an HMAC with the SHA256 hash function. Use the endpointâ€™s signing secret as the key, and use the signed\_payload string as the message.

**Step 4: Compare Signatures**\
Compare the signature in the header to the expected signature.

### Event Ordering

SureCart does not guarantee that webhook events will be delivered in the exact order they were triggered. For example, when a customer completes a checkout, the following events might be sent:

```
order.created

purchase.created

subscription.created
```

While these events are generated in a specific sequence, they may arrive at your webhook endpoint out of order due to network latency or retries.

Your webhook handler should not rely on receiving events in a strict sequence. Instead, it should be designed to handle events independently and idempotently. If necessary, use the SureCart API to retrieve related objects (such as an order, purchase, or subscription) when processing an event. This ensures that your integration remains consistent even when events arrive asynchronously or out of order.

### Handling Duplicate Events

Webhook endpoints may occasionally receive the same event more than once. This can happen due to retries or network-related issues. To prevent processing duplicates, we recommend storing the unique id of each received event. Before acting on a new event, check if its ID has already been handled.

In some cases, two distinct webhook events may reference the same underlying object. To identify true duplicates, compare both the `event -> type` and the `event -> data -> object -> id` fields. This helps ensure your system processes each meaningful event only once.

### Subscribe Only to Relevant Events

To improve performance and reduce unnecessary load on your webhook endpoint, configure it to listen only to the events your integration actually needs. Subscribing to all available events increases overhead and may lead to unnecessary processing.

You can configure which events your webhook receives directly from the SureCart Dashboard

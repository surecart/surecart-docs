The SureCart API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the SureCart platform dashboard.

There are two types of API keys â€“ public and secret. Your secret API key can be used to make requests to most API endpoints listed in this documentation. Your public API key can be used to make requests to any endpoints denoted as "Public". Your public API key is designed to be used in client side code and can be exposed.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

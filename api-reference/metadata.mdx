title: 'Metadata'
---

Some SureCart objects (i.e. Checkout and Product) have a metadata parameter. You can use this parameter to attach key-value data to these objects.

You can specify up to 50 keys, with key names up to 40 characters long and values up to 500 characters long.

Metadata is useful for storing additional, structured information on an object. Metadata is not used by SureCart and won't be seen by your users unless you choose to show it to them.

Do not store any sensitive information (bank account numbers, card details, etc.) as metadata.

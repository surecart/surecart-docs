title: 'Live & Test Mode'
---

When creating `Checkout`, `PaymentIntent`, `Subscription`, etc. objects you can specify `live_mode`. If you set `live_mode=false` then all interactions with processors will be done in their respective live or sandbox modes. This allows you to create test charges, subscriptions, and run full checkout flows without charging real payment methods.

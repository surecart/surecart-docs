<Note>
  **These are low-level actions for integration configuration changes.** <br /><br />
  If you are wanting to create a full purchase integration that handles granting access, refunds, upgrades, downgrades and more, please follow the [Purchase Integration Guide](/guides/orders-and-purchases).
</Note>

These actions fire when a merchant configures or removes product integrations in the SureCart admin. Product integrations are the automated actions that occur when a product is purchased—such as changing a user's WordPress role, enrolling them in a course, or adding them to a membership group.

## `surecart/integrations/create`

Fired when a merchant **adds** an integration to a product. For example, adding a "Change User Role" integration on the Edit Product page.

<ResponseField name="Parameters" type="Action Parameters">
  <Expandable title="properties">
    <ResponseField name="$params" type="array">
      The integration parameters including provider, model, and configuration.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

```php
add_action( 'surecart/integrations/create', function( $params ) {
    // Log when integrations are added
    error_log( 'Integration created: ' . print_r( $params, true ) );
    
    // Notify admin when a new integration is configured
    if ( ! empty( $params['provider'] ) ) {
        wp_mail(
            get_option( 'admin_email' ),
            'New Product Integration Added',
            sprintf( 'A %s integration was added to a product.', $params['provider'] )
        );
    }
} );
```

## `surecart/integrations/delete`

Fired when a merchant **removes** an integration from a product.

<ResponseField name="Parameters" type="Action Parameters">
  <Expandable title="properties">
    <ResponseField name="$params" type="array">
      The integration parameters that were removed.
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

```php
add_action( 'surecart/integrations/delete', function( $params ) {
    // Clean up any custom data when integration is removed
    error_log( 'Integration deleted: ' . print_r( $params, true ) );
} );
```
